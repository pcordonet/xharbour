   + Added formulas the usage is easy just drop the Formula component and set its value to whatever formula
     you want. Values can include other Formulas as well TEST->SALARY*@Formula2. Remember to use the @ symbol
     in front of the Formula component to point at it. DO NOT set @ as the formula name the system does it
     automatically.
